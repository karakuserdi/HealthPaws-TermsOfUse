<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last modified: July 2024</p>

<h2>Opt-out options: DO NOT USE MY DATA</h2>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION. REGIONAL PATTERNS (CALIFORNIA)</h3>
<p>Stable AI ("we," "us," or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines our data protection practices and explains the types of information we may process when you install and/or use the “Stable AI Image Generator & Video Converter” mobile application (the “App”, “our App”).</p>
<p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information), we mean any data relating to an identifiable person, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all users and others who access the App (“Users”).</p>
<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY USING THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong></p>
<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California residents have the right to request:</p>

    <li>The categories of personal information processed;</li>
    <li>The categories of sources from which personal information is obtained;</li>
    <li>The purpose for processing user personal data;</li>
    <li>The categories of third parties with whom we may share your personal information;</li>
    <li>The specific pieces of personal information that we might have obtained about a particular user, provided the data in the request is reliable enough to identify the user.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Note that according to CCPA, personal information does not include de-identified or aggregated consumer information.</p>

<h3>SHARING</h3>
<p>How your information can be shared <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
<p>All third parties involved in processing user data are service providers using this information based on an agreement and for business purposes.</p>

<h3>OPT-OUT OPTIONS</h3>
<p>If you do not want us to process your personal information anymore, please contact us through the <a href="#">contact form</a>. Note that the App may not function properly without certain data, and you may be advised to uninstall the App.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to share device identifiers and geolocation data with service providers, please check your device settings to opt out as described below <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

<h3>REQUESTS</h3>
<p>To submit a verifiable consumer request for access, portability, or deletion of personal data, please contact us through the <a href="#">contact form</a>. Include the phrase "Your rights to maintain confidentiality in the state of California."</p>
<p>When submitting a verifiable request, be prepared to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide sufficient information to reasonably verify your identity or that you are an authorized representative (e.g., name, address, city, state, zip code, email address). We may use this information to verify your identity through security questions. If an authorized agent is acting on your behalf, provide written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you.</li>
    <li>Describe your request in detail to help us understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to your request or provide personal information if we cannot (i) verify your identity or authority to make the request or (ii) confirm that the personal information relates to you. We may request additional information or documents to verify your identity and may use third-party identity verification services. This measure prevents the unauthorized disclosure of your personal information. Personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request will only be used to verify the requestor's identity or authority.</p>

<h3>SALE OF DATA</h3>
<p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

<h3>II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</h3>
<p>We process various categories of information.</p>

<h4>Functional Information</h4>
<p>We ask for and process the following information when you use the App, necessary for the contract between you and us. Without this information, we cannot provide the App's full functionality or requested services.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Activity Information:</strong> When you set the relevant device settings, we may access your camera or Photos to save files generated via the App or analyze pictures you upload. We cannot collect, store, or use pictures or files unless you upload or share them via the App.</li>
    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Defined and governed by our <a href="#">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy. You can use, share, download, or exploit your User Content at your own risk and responsibility. Ensure you save needed User Content immediately after creation, as future access or download is not guaranteed.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> (name, email address, and any other content included in emails) when you contact us via email or support form. We collect, store, and process this information through our cloud storage provider (Google.com, Inc.) to respond to inquiries, fulfill requests, send communications, and provide requested services.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information That Is Processed Automatically</h4>
<p>With your permission, we use third-party automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) to analyze information sent by your device via our App (Identity for Advertisers). Some tools (listed in Section IV) initiate automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, to evaluate personal aspects such as preferences, interests, behavior, location, or movements. Automatic processing begins once you allow our App to track your activity. You can withdraw your permission anytime – check opt-out options in Section VIII.</p>
<p>We may process some device and user behavior information based on our legitimate interest. This generally non-personal information, accessible in aggregated form, helps us improve our App and enhance user experience.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Details:</strong> Information reported from your device (tablet/phone/smartwatch), including “device identifiers” (unique identifiers that do not identify you personally). Device identifiers enable generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data that can be processed:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Information about the device: type, OS version, model, manufacturer, screen size, density, orientation, audio volume, battery life, loading time, latency, framerate, memory usage.</li>
    <li>Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, session timestamp and duration, speed, browser.</li>
    <li>Location-related information: IP address, country code/region/state/city, language setting, time zone, neighboring points of interest (e.g., coffee shop).</li>
    <li>Other device identifiers: user identifiers set by the App's developer.</li>
    <li>Information about applications: name, API key, version, App properties for processing and analysis. Some services record installed or running applications/processes.</li>
    <li>Cookies and similar technologies: Cookies (text files) and similar technologies (pixels, web beacons, scripts) may be used to operate the App more effectively, such as understanding and optimizing usage, improving marketing efforts, and providing content and features of interest.</li>
    <li>Log file information: Automatically reported log file information when you access the App, including start/stop times, and App interactions.</li>
    <li>Ad-related information: Data about ads viewed, clicked, conversion events, ad type (text/image/video), ad placement, user response.</li>
    <li>In-App events: Automatically recorded information on App usage (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, data processing methods).</li>
</ul>

<p>Information provided to advertising or analytics tools does not generally come under our control. Third-party services may engage in personal data profiling, linking device information to categorized data (e.g., age, gender) already in their databases. We do not control how third parties process your data collected by their means. Contact third parties directly for information requests regarding your personal information (see Section IV).</p>

<h4>Payment Information</h4>
<p>Our e-commerce provider (Apple) handles billing, processing, and charging for in-app purchases securely. This information is part of the contract between you and us. We cannot access

 or use your credit or debit card information.</p>
<p>Access applicable “in-app” purchase rules and policies directly from the app stores.</p>

<h3>III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>Our mission is to continually improve our App and provide new experiences. We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>To provide our service:</strong> We use functional and automatically processed information to deliver requested services.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve and monitor the App:</strong> We use automatically processed information to understand user behavior, detect outages and technical issues, and optimize our App.</li>
    <li><strong>To provide interest-based advertising:</strong> We use automatically processed information for marketing purposes, delivering personalized ads based on your preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>To communicate with you:</strong> We use contact information for newsletters, marketing notifications, feedback, and policy updates. We also respond to your inquiries.</li>
    <li><strong>To prevent fraud and spam, and enforce the law:</strong> We use your information to maintain a safe, spam-free App, detect fraud, protect trademarks, and enforce Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If new purposes for processing your personal data arise, we will notify you by updating this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>IV. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We share your information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. We adhere to the U.S. Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for the Mobile Environment.</p>
<p>We choose third parties that apply necessary technical and organizational measures to protect user data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to third parties. We are not responsible for unauthorized access or accidental loss of your data through third parties' faults.</p>

<h3>V. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>We operate globally, providing our App to users worldwide. Automatically processed information may be transferred across borders from your country to others.</p>
<p>If you are in the European Union or other regions with different data processing laws, note that we may transfer information, including personal data, to countries with different data protection laws. This means your personal information can be transferred to countries or international organizations where data protection regulations may not provide the same level of protection.</p>
<p>We ensure that any recipient of personal data provides appropriate protection in accordance with current legislation. By using the App, you agree to such transfers.</p>
<p>For data storage, we use hosting organizations and encrypt your personal data when possible before sending it to hosting providers. We work only with hosting organizations that pass our security and reliability checks.</p>

<p><strong>Opt-out of marketing tracking:</strong></p>
<p>Manage activity tracking permissions. To opt-out of personalized ads:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Settings > Privacy > Tracking, then turn off permission to track for specific apps. Disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track" to avoid prompts.

<p>If you do not want third-party providers to use your precise location data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For iOS 11 or later: turn off Location Services for the applicable Product via Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Set the App's "Share My Location" status to "Never." More information <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IX. SECURITY</h3>
<p>We prioritize the security of your personal information. We follow industry standards to protect data during transmission and upon receipt.</p>
<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including encryption and data minimization, to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. In case of a security breach, we will promptly notify you as required by law.</p>
<p>For security questions, contact us through the <a href="#">contact form</a>.</p>
